# Predicting Physical Activity Using ML

### *Ivan Valiente*

### *April 1st 2017*


## Executive Summary

The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts the type of "personal activity" using measurements from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 individuals.

The participants in the data colection were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 
different ways.

The candidate-models will be trained to predict the "classe" variable in the training set, by using any other 
variables in the data set.

The final prediction model will be used to predict 20 different test cases provided in the "test" data set.

In this repositori you will find the project report in 3 formats:
